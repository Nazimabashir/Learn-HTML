    <h1>Coffee Introduction</h1>

    <p style="width: 50%">
      Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
      berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee
      fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
      green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them
      into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine
      particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered
      out, producing a cup of coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly
      acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
      caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4]
      and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
      French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually
      served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar
      substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or
      enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet
      dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared
      coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be
      confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).
