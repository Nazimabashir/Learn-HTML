    <p>
      Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
      berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee
      fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
      green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them
      into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine
      particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered
      out, producing a cup of coffee.

    <h3>French Coffee</h3>
    <br />

    <p>
      It isn't a particular bean, brew, blend, or style. It doesn't mean that
      it's made from French roast coffee beans. It doesn't refer to coffee made
      in a French press. French coffee is none of those things. French coffee is
      a culture. It's how the French drink and enjoy their coffee instead of
      what they're actually drinking in their cup. Many coffee aficionados
      regard French coffee as slightly bitter, made from nothing more than
      average beans. But the taste, flavor, and preparation have little to do
      with what it is. French coffee is about the experience — sitting in a
      sidewalk café, watching people and watching the world go by as you relax
      and enjoy a hot, strong cup. It's less a drink and more a way of life.
